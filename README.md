# Pyproj: The minimal Python project

pyproj was born as an experiment. The problem to solve: what does a
Python project that supports...:

* tox
* pip-style installation
* py.test
* virtualenv
* Travis CI

...look like? Here it is, lean, mean, and keeping it as simple as possible, but no simpler.

## How to contribute

Know of some additional, open-source module/project pyproj isn't
taking advantage of? Feel like adding documentation or examples? Is
something not idiomatic? Send in a patch!

## Roadmap

* Sphinx docs
* Improved HISTORY.md
* PyPi integration
